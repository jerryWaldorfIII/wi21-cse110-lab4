1. print to standard output the length of prices, the last value of i before it exits the for loop
2. print to standard output the last discounted price
3. print to standard output the last final price rounded to two decimal places
4. [50,100,150] : each price will be discounted 50%
5. A reference error is thrown because i is not defined
6. A reference error is thrown because discountedPrice is not defined
7. pint to standard output the last final price rounded to two decimal places
8. the function throws an exceptiona and does not return a value
9. the program does not reach line 11 as in line 7 we are attempting to change a const variable, but if it did reach line 11 a reference error would be thrown as i is not defined
10. the program does not reach line 12 as in line 7 we are attempting to change a const variable, but if it did reach line 12 a reference error would be thrown as discountedPrice is not defined
11. the program does not reach line 12 as in line 7 we are attempting to change a const variable, but if it did reach line 13 it would print out 0 to standard output as it was the initial value of the const varible finalPrice
12. the program does not complete as in line 7 we are attempting to change a const variable, but if it did complete the function would return an empty array as this was the initial value of the const varibale discounted
13. A) student.name
13. B) student['Grad Year']
13. C) student.greeting()
13. D) student['Favorite Teacher'].name
13. E) student.courseLoad[0]
14. A) '32' : concats the second element as a string because the first is a string
14. B) 1 : there is no minus operator on strings so it interprets the first string '3' as an int
14. C) 3 : keeps 3 as an int and interprets null as 0
14. D) '3null' : concats 3 and null and interprets null as a string
14. E) 4 : interprets true as a 1 and adds it to 3
14. F) 0 : interprets false as a 0 and null as a 0
14. G)'3undefined' : concats undefined to 3 and interprets undefined as a string
14. H) NaN : there is no minus operator on strings
15. A) true : interprets 2 as an int
15. B) false : compares them as strings
15. C) true : interprets '2' as an int
15. D) false : they are not truly equal as they are different types
15. E) false : true is interpretted as a 1
15. F) true : Boolean(2) is true
16. == interprets both sides of the equality in order to compare, as === compares them as it
17. How are you? : 2 is not equal to true as true is interpretted as 1, 2 as a boolean is true
19. The result will be [6,8,10]. Each element of the array passed in is first used as an input to the doSomething function which adds 2 to each element, then this element is multiplied by 2 in the modifyArray function.
21. 1 4 3 2
